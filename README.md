Please note that this is *very* old, and comes from a time when I only really used python to make automation scripts and for my own amusement. I haven't really touched python in the last two years, and as you can see in pull requests, dependabot has been bugging me about out-of-date dependencies for a while now.

I won't be using or mainting this any further. Feel free to take a look at the code or fork, though I'm sure the code is just horrible. For your convenience, I'll re-license to Unlicense before archiving.
